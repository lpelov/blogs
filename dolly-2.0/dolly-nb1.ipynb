       "[{'generated_text': 'Nuclear fusion occurs when two light atomic nuclei join together to form a heavier one. This process releases binding energy in the form of heat and light. Nuclear fusion takes place in the cores of stars like our sun, but here on earth, we can also trigger nuclear fusion in the laboratory by bombarding light atomic nuclei with slow neutrons.\\nNuclear fission is a process in which a light atomic nucleus splits into two or more smaller fragments. The nucleus of an atom is usually entirely encased in a positive electrical charge and is thus strongly held together. When a heavy atom splits into two or more pieces, some of the positive electrical charge is no longer attached to a single nucleus. This increased separation of the nuclei, called quantum excitation, permits the heavy nuclei to move around more freely and thus decreases the binding energy of the atom. As the binding energy decreases, more energy is released the this process is called fission. \\n\\nNuclear fission is usually thought of as a much faster process than nuclear fusion, but the reverse is actually true. It takes a lot of energy to initiate nuclear fusion, but when it occurs, it happens very rapidly. Nuclear fission is also quite energy intensive, but once initiated, the process slows down considerably.'}]"

A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage.\\\n",
    "Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of our significant operations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\\\n",
    "Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses.\\\n",
